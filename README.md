# TeamSync
Introduction :
Project Description: As the title says, TeamSync is a collaborative platform designed to help teams (in the schools as well as in the professional milieu) to work together simultaneously. It combines the various aspects of team work such as file sharing, communication, task assigning, task sharing and even edit shared documents all on one platform. Throughout these activities, every data, that is messages, files or even updates are stored in cloud servers.

Problem Statement(Why this project):
In Recent times, teams face significant challenges in maintaining seamless collaboration. Communication is often fragmented, requiring members to switch between multiple applications for messaging, file sharing, and task tracking such as from WhatsApp to google drive or Trello back to WhatsApp. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies, missed updates, and delays in project completion. In regions with inconsistent internet connectivity*especially in parts of Africa) making it difficult to work accurately. As a result of this, a unified platform that integrates real-time communication, cloud storage, task management, and collaborative editing, while also being scalable, fault-tolerant, and capable of supporting offline operations to ensure uninterrupted team productivity will be off great use in the society.

Proposed Solution:
A platform where everything is available. This platform uses microservices and distributed databases to ensure that if one server fails, another one automatically takes over, limiting data loss making it scalable. The core features of TeamSync include; Real time communication, including messages and notifications among team members, file sharing and cloud storage, project management and task tracking as well as collaborative editing. 

What makes the difference:
This platform is a real Game Changer because it involves the key features of various working tools we use, when put together as a team to work on a project. These tools include WhatsApp or telegram for communication, Google drive for file sharing (specifically to make it accessible to everyone), Google Docs for making documents editable by those to whom access is granted, and Trello or Jira for task distribution and tracking. TeamSync is a combination of all these major features into a single platform, by so doing better organizing work and facilitating the follow up and momentum of the project.

Key advantage:
Acknowledging the fact that certain region (especially in Africa) has internet difficulties, TeamSync is built in with hybrid online – offline model that allows minimal tasks such as editing tasks, composing messages or sending of notifications which are automatically synchronized with the cloud once internet is enabled.

Factors that Make It Scalable, Fault Tolerant, and Collaborative:
As architecture, it uses Microservice based Distributed architecture and deployed on the cloud.
Scalable:
This platform uses microservices and distributed databases to ensure that if one server fails, another one automatically takes over, limiting data loss making it scalable. Another factor that makes TeamSync scalable is its ability to manage multiple users at once.
Fault Tolerant:
 Its ability to be fault tolerant is seen in the replication of data, that is messages, tasks or files across multiple database nodes and cloud servers in such a way that the break down on one doesn’t disrupt the system, and another one takes over. Also due to the offline synchronization, permitting users to work offline during internet disruptions, during which the data is stored locally and synchronized automatically when internet is restored.
Collaboration: 
Finally, Collaboration is seen in several ways such as; Real time communication with the help of WebSockets to enable instant messaging as well as letting multiple users see notifications simultaneously. In addition to that, all media, documents and project resources are stored in cloud storage accessible by authorized users only.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, TeamSync is that platform that combines every aspect of team, project management and efficient, all while maintaining high experience and making accessible every team project working feature available on a single platform. THIS, as a result creates a more connected, collaborative, scalable and resilient digital workforce efficient in Africa and Beyond.
